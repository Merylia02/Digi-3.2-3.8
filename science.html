                In-class notes are very important!!! Work on diagrams because they CAN contribute to a higher grade if you don't write a good answer. Technically you do not have to do the achieved sections but it is much safer to do them! They don't take very long, usually a labeling diagram or filling out table questions. For the internals, make sure to check the marking schedule and past exemplars for the format your reports should be in so you don't miss anything.

                Make sure you memorize the definitions/typical written answers that come up nearly every year (reading through the answer schedules for each year can help you find out which questions always get repeated)
                For organics, make sure the reaction scheme is burned into your brain-- it'll be useful for all questions, and level 3 chemistry as well.
                For written answers, it's better to overwrite than underwrite (although make sure it's relevant and useful information/explanations)

                Study using 'No Brain Too Small' and the exam past papers (the extended catalog can be found on the 'No Brain Too Small' website). Make sure you know all the concepts and memorize the definitions/typical written answers that come up nearly every year (e.g. centripetal force). Always round to the lowest number of significant figures that are given in the question, and never forget units. In the exams, a formula will usually only be used once. Some 'explain' questions can be answered by just putting in the relevant equation and explaining it. Do any homework assigned throughout the year so that you don't have to do all the study at once.

                Give yourself plenty of time for internals as biology internals are quite long. Whether it is an at-home internal - don’t procrastinate just get it done! Or if it’s an in-class internal - make sure you have soaked up all the knowledge possible so you can write fast so you don’t miss out on anything. Always listen to the lessons thoroughly and take as many notes as possible. For exams, it is SUPER helpful to make mind maps of everything in the topic on one piece of paper. I did this and read it right before I walked into my exams and remembered everything.

                For biology I really recommend getting the definitions into your brain asap, especially for exams cause there are so many (flashcards help). For internals go over everything with your teacher and even check with the head of bio as she oversees everything.
