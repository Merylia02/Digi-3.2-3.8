            <br>
            <p class="resourceText">
                This is my personal favorite management method that can be applied to a variety of things. I have used this management method in subjects like (Business, Photography, Digital Technologies, and more). This method requires you to create a board with 3 categories (To do, Doing, Done) you can add more if required. You basically list out what you need to do into the 'To Do' category and then move it to 'Doing' when you're working on it; When you are done with the task you can then move it to 'Done'. It's as simple as that. Online tools that can help you set up your board it Microsoft Planner, Trello, and more that you can look for.

            <br>
            <p class="resourceText">
                You probably know that it is very important to have a calendar when keeping track of your work; What you might not know is the difference between a digital calendar and a physical one. Digital calendars are great, they are able to have many features attached to them. it also has its own cons that is the fact that it's difficult to visualise how much time you have left on large projects, nor do you get the satisfaction of going through a day. I highly recommend printing a calendar at the start of the year.

                It is also recommended that you and your friends tell each other what you have to do. This helps each other keep track of what work you have next and strengthens relationships. You can even make your own rules on how you help each other.

            <h3 class="resourceH3">Priority Matrix</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="resourceText">
                The priority matrix is a time management method focusing on getting things done based on their priority. Things that are urgent and important are the first priority, then comes important, then urgent. This makes sure that you aren't missing out on something important over something that isn't.

                It is a good habit to spend the time that you study and work around an hour before you take a break.
                When taking a break I usually spend half an hour before continuing with my studies.
                It is essential to make time in your life to study consistently.

            <h3 class="resourceH3">D</h3>
            <p class="resourceText">Don’t procrastinate since it will cause you a lot of stress. Some due dates might seem far away and they are but once they creep up you will be unable to do the large amount of work in time. It is best to take short breaks since long breaks often cause the person to lose focus which is difficult to regain later on. It is also important to have a list of things you need to do, it may be tedious but it really helps with keeping on track and not missing out on things you need to do.</p>
