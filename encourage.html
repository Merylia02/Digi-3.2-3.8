 "You can do it—as long as you are well-planned and study according to your plan, you will be able to achieve your goals. The practice exams are usually harder than the real exams, so if you do poorly in the practice ones, it's not over yet :) Remember to take care of yourself—your mental health is always the priority and it's good to keep things in perspective. Never be afraid to ask for help from classmates, friends, teachers, counselors, etc. Yr 13 students are usually open to sharing their own notes/essays from last year, so you can always ask us!!"
